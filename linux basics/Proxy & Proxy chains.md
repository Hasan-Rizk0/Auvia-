Proxy is just a mediator it talks to the server that you want to talk to on your behalf. 

When using proxy server your IP address is not used to talk to the server any more, instead the IP address of the proxy server do this job.

It gives the user some anonymity, however it is not the best choice if you want to become completely invisible on the internet.

A proxy server cannot encrypt data...


Proxy chain is actually more than one proxy that are being used sequentially, which increases the anonymity no more (still not the best choice if you want to be invisible on the internet).
