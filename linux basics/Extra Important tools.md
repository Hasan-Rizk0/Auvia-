sort ---> display the content in the alphabetical order (not only the letter, also the number are ordered)

uniq ---> report or omit repeated lines (-c to count how much a line is repeated)
However they should be sorted before 
(uniq only compares ((((adjacent files)))))

base64 or base32 or... ---> decode and encode text
